#' @description This is a teaching tool to encourage interaction in programming classes. 
#'     It is based on the existance of an FTP server where files are shared and exchanged.
#' 
#' @usage: 
#' 1. Students are working in class and a student wants to know why their code
#'    failed or you want to show a working (or not working) example from a
#'    particular student.  The student pushes the file with push("myFile.R")
#'    and you pull it with pull("myFile.R", who="studentId").  Now you can
#'    open the file in your current R session.
#' 
#' @details:
#' Students use push(files) to upload file(s) from their computer to
#'   the sftp site in their folder (as specified by their setup user name).
#'   Typically one or more files in the current folder are specified, but
#'   relative and absolute locations are allowed.
#'   Students use pull(files) to download files to their current folder
#'   from the root folder of the ftp site.
# '  Teachers use push(files) to upload file(s) from their computer to the
#'   sftp site's root folder (by specifying user name ".").
#'   Teachers use pull(files, who="studentUserId") to download one or more
#'   student files to their current folder.
